userPromptTemplate: |
  Analyze the following AI response for brand and competitor mentions.

  Response to analyze:
  {{response}}

  Brand to track: {{brandName}}
  Competitors to track: {{competitors}}

  Your task:
  1. Extract any rankings or ordered lists of companies mentioned in the response
     - Note the position, company name, reason for ranking (if provided), and sentiment
  
  2. Determine if {{brandName}} is mentioned anywhere in the response:
     - Check for direct mentions (exact name)
     - Check for variations (with/without spaces, punctuation, suffixes like Inc/LLC/Corp)
     - Check for possessive forms ({{brandName}}'s)
     - Check for common variations: "{{brandNameNoSpaces}}", "{{brandNameLowercase}}"
  
  3. Identify which competitors from the list are mentioned
  
  4. Assess the overall sentiment towards the brand if mentioned
  
  5. Rate your confidence in the analysis (0-1 scale)

  Be thorough - a company is "mentioned" if it appears ANYWHERE in the text, even without a specific ranking.
  Look in all contexts: listed, compared, recommended, discussed, referenced, etc.
  
  The company names in the rankings should be actual company names, not product names. 
  The companies in the rankings list doesn't necessary have to be from the competitor list but if it looks like the one from the 
  competitor list use the competitor name in the ranking.
